{\projectName} is a subscription model that allows a client to hedge Ethereum gas price volatility in a simple way and a provider to speculate on these Gas prices. When the gas price is low,  {\projectName}'s contract can be considered as insurance against the rise of this price. Moreover, when cleverly combined with other existing solutions (ex: Gas tokens), the system can end up in a win-win situation where both the client and provider respectively save and earn money. Anyone can create a subscription contract and trade its ownerships, which implies a competitive market. Holding some \$REF tokens allows one to have voting power on the future of the system and also to earn some dividends produced by ownership transactions and contract completion.
There remain some future improvements to work on, including better decentralisation, optimising Internal gas fee usage, and a combination with gas tokens.
