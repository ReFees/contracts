	abstract = {This technical whitepaper explains some of the design decisions behind the Uniswap v2 core contracts. It covers the contracts’ new features—including arbitrary pairs between ERC20s, a hardened price oracle that allows other contracts to estimate the time-weighted average price over a given interval, “ﬂash swaps” that allow traders to receive assets and use them elsewhere before paying for them later in the transaction, and a protocol fee that can be turned on in the future. It also re-architects the contracts to reduce their attack surface. This whitepaper describes the mechanics of Uniswap v2’s “core” contracts including the pair contract that stores liquidity providers’ funds—and the factory contract used to instantiate pair contracts.},

We’ll define and examine what makes a secure oracle mechanism reliable enough to be used by smart contracts for external data delivery, off-chain payment execution, and provable off-chain computation. We’ll go over the security risks and failure scenarios to be avoided based on various smart contract’s reliance on an oracle mechanism as their trigger and/or payment mechanism; closely examining the methods that developers should keep in mind for minimizing the most common failure scenarios. We’ll look in depth at how decentralization can help make oracle mechanisms more secure through the use of a decentralized oracle network, while also presenting a defense in-depth approach that applies additional layers of security through the use of Trusted Execution Environments, and cutting edge approaches like TownCrier.

	title = {Cyclic {Arbitrage} in {Decentralized} {Exchange} {Markets}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02784},
	abstract = {Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) such as UniSwap allow users to create trading pools between any pair of cryptocurrencies. The exchange rate of each trading pool is independent, which introduces arbitrage opportunities with trading through different cryptocurrencies: Traders are able to trade cryptocurrencies cyclically: A trader can exchange currency \$A\$ for \$B\$, then \$B\$ for \$C\$, and finally \$C\$ for \$A\$ again through three different trading pools. Almost surely, the three floating exchange rates are not perfectly in sync, which opens up arbitrage possibilities for cyclic trading. In this paper, we study cyclic arbitrages in DEXes of cryptocurrencies with transaction-level data on Uniswap, measuring 285,127 cyclic arbitrages over nine months. We conduct a theoretical analysis and an empirical evaluation to understand cyclic arbitrages systematically. We study the market size (the revenue and the cost) of cyclic arbitrages, the influence of cyclic arbitrages, and the implementations of cyclic arbitrages.Beyond the understanding of cyclic arbitrages, this paper suggests that with the smart contract technology and the replicated state machine setting of Ethereum, arbitrage strategies are easier implemented in DEXes than in Centralized Exchanges (CEXes). We find that deploying private smart contracts to implement cyclic arbitrages is more resilient to front-running attacks than applying cyclic arbitrages through public (open-source) smart contracts.},

While they are supported by prominent cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, their further adoption is hindered by fundamental scalability challenges. For instance, in Ethereum contract execution suﬀers from a latency of more than 15 seconds, and the total number of contracts that can be executed per second is very limited. State channel networks are one of the core primitives aiming to address these challenges. They form a second layer over the slow and expensive blockchain, thereby enabling instantaneous contract processing at negligible costs.},

However, they currently exhibit high latencies and fail to handle transaction loads comparable to those managed by traditional financial systems. Layer-two protocols, built on top of (layer-one) blockchains, avoid disseminating every transaction to the whole network by exchanging authenticated transactions off-chain. Instead, they utilize the expensive and low-rate blockchain only as a recourse for disputes. The promise of layer-two protocols is to complete off-chain transactions in sub-seconds rather than minutes or hours while retaining asset security, reducing fees and allowing blockchains to scale.We systematize the evolution of layer-two protocols over the period from the inception of cryptocurrencies in 2009 until today, structuring the multifaceted body of research on layer-two transactions. Categorizing the research into payment and state channels, commit-chains and protocols for refereed delegation, we provide a comparison of the protocols and their properties. We provide a systematization of the associated synchronization and routing protocols along with their privacy and security aspects. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) clears the layer-two fog, highlights the potential of layer-two solutions and identifies their unsolved challenges, indicating propitious avenues of future work.},
